# Typed Routing Proposal

*__The following is a proposal for a typed routing system. Some of it is
implemented in [a PR](https://github.com/csells/go_router/pull/130), but it is
not done yet nor is it currently available as a supported part of the go_router
package. I'm writing this down as a way to do what I like doing: focusing on the
client code I want to write instead of focusing only on the implementation.__*

*__Note: this proposal assumes the implementation of [this
feature](https://github.com/csells/go_router/issues/173).__*

## Goal

Routing in go_router fundamentally relies on the ability to match a string-based
location in a URI format into one or more page builders, each that require zero
or more arguments that are passed as path and query parameters as part of the
location. The go_router does a good job of making the path and query parameters
available via the `params` and `queryParams` properties of the `GoRouterState`
object, but often the page builder must first parse the parameters into types
that aren't `String`s, e.g.

```dart
GoRoute(
  path: ':authorId',
  pageBuilder: (context, state) {
    // require the authorId to be present and be an integer
    final authorId = int.parse(state.params['authorId']!);
    final selectedAuthor = libraryInstance.allAuthors
        .firstWhereOrNull((a) => a.id == authorId);

    return MaterialPage<void>(
      key: state.pageKey,
      child: AuthorDetailsScreen(author: selectedAuthor),
    );
  },
),
```

In this example, the `authorId` parameter is a) required and b) must be an
`int`. However, neither of these requirements are checked until run-time, making
it easy to write code that is not type-safe, e.g.

```dart
void _tap() => context.go('/author/a42'); // error: `a42` is not an `int`
```

Since Dart is a statically typed language, we'd love to have mistakes get caught
at compile-time instead of waiting until run-time. The goal of the typed routing
proposal is to provide an optional way to define the required and optional
parameters that a specific route consumes and to use code generation to take our
the drudgery of writing a bunch of `go`, `push` and `location` boilerplate code
implementations ourselves.

The code generator to do this work today in [our experimental
implementation](https://github.com/csells/go_router/pull/130) is the
[build_runner](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner) package but the plan is to
move to [Dart
macros](https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/working/macros/feature-specification.md)
when they're available.

## Defining a route

Define each route as a class deriving from the base w/ the appropriate
transition type, i.e. Material, Cupertino or custom. Required parameters are
pulled from the route's `path` (defined in the [route tree](#route-tree) as
described below):

```dart
class PersonRoute extends GoRouteData {
  PersonRoute({required this.fid, required this.pid});
  final String fid;
  final String pid;

  Widget build(BuildContext context) => PersonPage(fid: fid, pid: pid);
} 
```

## Route tree

The tree of routes is defined as an attribute on each of the top-level routes:

```dart
@TypedGoRoute<HomeRoute>(
  path: '/',
  routes: [
    TypedGoRoute<FamilyRoute>(
      path: 'family/:fid',
      routes: [
        TypedGoRoute<PersonRoute>(
          path: 'person/:pid', 
        ),
      ], 
    ),
  ],
)
class HomeRoute extends GoRouteData {...}
class FamilyRoute extends GoRouteData {...}
class PersonRoute extends GoRouteData {...}

@TypedGoRoute<LoginRoute>(path: '/login')
class LoginRoute extends GoRouteData {...}
```

## `GoRouter` initialization

The code generator aggregates all top-level routes into a single list called
`$appRoutes` for use in initializing the `GoRouter` instance:

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(routes: $appRoutes, errorPageBuilder: ...);
```

## Error page builder

You can use custom routes to provide an error page builder as well:

```dart
class ErrorRoute extends GoRouteData {
  ErrorRoute({required this.error});
  final Exception error;

  Widget build(BuildContext context) => ErrorPage(error: error);
}
```

With this in place, you can provide the `errorPageBuilder` parameter like so:

```dart
final _router = GoRouter(
  routes: $appRoutes,
  errorPageBuilder: (c, s) => ErrorRoute(s.error).buildPage(c, s),
);
```

## Navigation

Navigate using the `go` or `push` methods provided by the code generator:

```dart
void _tap() => PersonRoute(fid: 'f2', pid: 'p1').go(context);
```

If you get this wrong, the compiler will complain:

```dart
// error: missing required parameter 'fid'
void _tap() => PersonRoute(pid: 'p1').go(context);
```

## Query parameters

Optional parameters indicate query parameters:

```dart
class LoginRoute extends GoRouteData {
  LoginRoute({this.from});
  final String? from; 
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => LoginPage(from: from);
}
```

## Extra parameters

A route can consume an extra parameter by taking it as a typed constructor
parameter with the special name `$extra`:

```dart
class PersonRouteWithExtra extends GoRouteData {
  PersonRouteWithExtra(this.$extra);
  final Person $extra;

  Widget build(BuildContext context) => PersonPage(person: $extra); 
}
```

Pass the extra param as a typed object:

```dart
void _tap() => PersonRouteWithExtra(Person(name: 'Marvin', age: 42)).go(context);
```

## Redirection

Redirect using the `location` property on a route provided by the code
generator:

```dart
redirect: (state) {
  final loggedIn = loginInfo.loggedIn;
  final loggingIn = state.subloc == HomeRoute().location;
  if( !loggedIn && !loggingIn ) return LoginRoute(from: state.subloc).location;
  if( loggedIn && loggingIn ) return HomeRoute().location;
  return null; 
}
```

## Route-level redirection

Handle route-level redirects by implementing the `redirect` method on the
route:

```dart
class HomeRoute extends GoRouteData {
  // no need to implement [build] when this [redirect] is unconditional
  String? redirect(GoRouterState state) => BooksRoute().location;
} 
```

## Type conversions

The code generator can convert simple types like `int` and `enum` to/from the
`String` type of the underlying params:

```dart
enum BookKind { all, popular, recent }

class BooksRoute extends GoRouteData {
  BooksRoute({this.kind = BookKind.popular});
  final BookKind kind;
  
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => BooksPage(kind: kind);
}
```

## Transitions

By default, the `GoRouter` will use the transition associated with the app it
finds in the widget tree, e.g. `MaterialApp`, `CupertinoApp`, `WidgetApp`, etc.
and use that the corresponding page type to create the page that wraps the
`Widget` returned by the route's `build` method, e.g. `MaterialPage`,
`CupertinoPage`, `Page`, etc. Furthermore,it will use the `state.pageKey`
property to set the `key` property of the page.

### Transition override

If you'd like to change how the page is created, e.g. to use a different page
type or to pass non-default parameters when creating the page (like a custom
key), you can override the `buildPage` method of the base class:

```dart
class MyMaterialRouteWithKey extends GoRouteData {
  static final _key = LocalKey('my-route-with-key');

  Widget build(BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) => MyPage();
  
  MaterialPage<void> buildPage(BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) =>
    MaterialPage<void>(
      key: _key,
      child: build(context, state),
    );
} 
```

### Custom transitions

Overriding the `buildPage` method is also useful for custom transitions:

```dart
class FancyRoute extends GoRouteData {
  Widget build(BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) => FancyPage();

  MaterialPage<void> buildPage(BuildContext context, GoRouterState state) =>
    CustomTransitionPage<void>(
      key: state.pageKey,
      child: build(context, state),
      transitionsBuilder: (context, animation, animation2, child) =>
          RotationTransition(turns: animation, child: child),
    ),
} 
```
