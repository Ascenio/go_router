# Welcome to go_router!

The purpose of [the go_router package](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router) is to
use declarative routes to reduce complexity, regardless of the platform you're
targeting (mobile, web, desktop), handling deep and dynamic linking from
Android, iOS and the web, along with a number of other navigation-related
scenarios, while still (hopefully) providing an easy-to-use developer
experience.
